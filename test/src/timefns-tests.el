  ;; Donâ€™t use (0 0 0 0) as the test case, as there are too many bugs
  ;; in MS-Windows (and presumably other) C libraries when formatting
  ;; time stamps near the Epoch of 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC, and this
  ;; test is for GNU Emacs, not for C runtimes.  Instead, look before
  ;; you leap: "look" is the timestamp just before the first leap
  ;; second on 1972-06-30 23:59:60 UTC, so it should format to the
  ;; same string regardless of whether the underlying C library
  ;; ignores leap seconds, while avoiding circa-1970 glitches.
  ;;
  ;; Similarly, stick to the limited set of time zones that are
  ;; supported by both POSIX and MS-Windows: exactly 3 ASCII letters
  ;; in the abbreviation, and no DST.
