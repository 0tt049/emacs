This branch introduces a new tutorial in English, and written with
org-mode. The tutorial is written, but the infrastructure for
displaying it is not.

tutorial.el has lots of functionality in it, that would be good to
use. Lots of cleverness wrt to rebound functions and the like.

It doesn't have org-mode support yet.

An in use tutorial is saved at ~/.emacs.d/tutorial/English.tut
and the position in stored in the first two lines (clearly this is
going to cause org-mode breakage)

The name of the source for the tutorial file is in the leim/mule files
(so english.el) -- so we can reconfigure it for different languages.

Functions like "tutorial--saved-file" assume that there is only one
type of file. So, we have to do something vaguely clever hear based on
the current file.

All the tutorial modification functions are going to end badly, I fear
(modified hooks, that sort of thing). Ironically, most of these insert
English even into non-english language buffer. But do I care about
this, given that it's all shite about keybindings?


 - [ ] edit leim to add tutorial-org
 - [ ] have help-with-tutorial check for this
