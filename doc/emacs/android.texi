@node What is Android?
@section Android history

  Android is an operating system for mobile devices developed by the
Open Handset Alliance, a group of companies interested in developing
handsets that can run a common set of software.  It is supposedly free
software.

  Like the X Consortium of times past, the Open Handset Alliance
believes that ``openness'' (namely, the regular release of the Android
source code) is simply a tool to increase the popularity of the
Android platform.  Computer companies normally produce proprietary
software.  The companies in the Open Handset Alliance are no different
-- most versions of Android installed on devices are proprietary, by
virtue of containing proprietary components, that often cannot even be
replaced by the user.

  Android is not designed to respect users' freedom.  Almost all
versions of Android (including some which are supposedly free
software) include support for Digital Restrictions Management,
technology that is designed to limit users' ability to copy media to
and from their own devices.  Most Android devices also come with
proprietary Google applications which are required to run the system,
and many other Android applications.

  Thus, it must be necessary to consider Android proprietary software
from a practical standpoint.  That is an injustice.  If you use
Android, we urge you to switch to a free operating system, if only for
your freedom's sake.

  We support GNU Emacs on proprietary operating systems because we
hope this taste of freedom will inspire users to escape from them.

@node Android Startup
@section Starting up Emacs on Android

  Emacs is not installed on Android devices from source code, or by a
package manager.  Instead, Emacs is compiled for Android on a
different operating system, with the resulting binaries packaged into
an archive, that is then transferred to the device and unpacked.

After being unpacked, Emacs instructs the system to display an
application icon on the desktop.  Emacs then starts up once the
application icon is clicked.

@cindex ``adb logcat''

During startup, Emacs will display messages in the system log buffer;
reading that buffer requires the Android Debug Bridge (@code{adb})
utility to be installed on another computer; it cannot be read on the
computer running Android itself.

After enabling the ``USB Debugging'' feature on the Android system,
and connecting it via USB to another system with the @code{adb}
utility installed, the log can be viewed by running the following
command on that other system:

@example
$ adb logcat | grep -E "(android_run_debug_thread|[Ee]macs)"
@end example

@node Android File System
@section What files Emacs can access under Android
@cindex /assets directory, android

  Emacs exposes a special directory on Android systems: the name of
the directory is @file{/assets}, and it contains the @file{etc},
@file{lisp} and @file{info} directories which are normally installed
in @file{/usr/share/emacs} directory on GNU and Unix systems.

@cindex limitations of the /assets directory

This directory exists because Android does not extract the contents of
application packages on to the file system while unpacking them, but
instead requires programs like Emacs to access its contents using a
special ``asset manager'' interface.  Here are the peculiarities that
result from such an implementation:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Subprocesses (such as @command{ls}) can not run from the
@file{/assets} directory, so Dired, and functions such as
@code{list-directory} do not work.

@item
There are no @file{.} and @file{..} directories inside the
@file{/assets} directory.

@item
Files in the @file{/assets} directory are always read only, and have
to be completely read in to memory each time they are opened.

@item
@code{directory-files} does not return a useful value on the
@file{/assets} directory itself, and does not return subdirectories
inside subdirectories of the @file{/assets} directory.
@end itemize

  Aside from the @file{/assets} directory, Android programs normally
have access to three other directories.  They are:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The @dfn{app data} directory.  This also serves as the home directory
for Emacs, and is always accessible read-write.

@item
The @dfn{app library} directory.  This is automatically appended to
@code{exec-path} upon startup.

@item
The @dfn{external storage} directory.  This is accessible to Emacs
when the user grants the @code{Files and media} permission to Emacs
via system settings.
@end itemize

The external storage directory is found at @file{/sdcard}; the other
directories are not found at any fixed location.

@node Android Environment
@section Running Emacs under Android

  From the perspective of users, Android is mostly a single user
operating system; however, from the perspective of applications and
Emacs, the system has an overwhelming number of users!

  Each application runs in its own user, with his own home directory,
which is the app data directory (@pxref{Android File System}.)

  Each application is also prohibited from accessing system
directories, and the app data directories of other applications.  In
recent versions of Android, the system also prohibits, for security
reasons, even Emacs itself from running executables inside the app
data directory!

  Emacs comes with several binaries.  While being executable files,
they are packaged as libraries in the library directory, because
otherwise the system will not unpack them while Emacs is being
installed.  This means, instead of specifying @code{ctags} or
@code{emacsclient} in a subprocess, Lisp code must specify
@code{libctags.so} or @code{libemacsclient.so} on the commnd line
instead when starting either of those programs in a subprocess.

@c TODO: remove this limitation.
  In addition, the @file{/assets} directory containing Emacs start-up
files is inaccessible to processes not directly created by
@code{zygote}, the system service responsible for starting
applications.  This makes it impossible to run Emacs in a subprocess
within itself.

@section Running Emacs in the background
@cindex emacs killed, android
@cindex emacs in the background, android

  Application processes are treated as disposable entities by the
system.  When all Emacs frames move to the background, Emacs is liable
to be killed by the system at any time, for the purpose of saving
resources.  There is currently no easy way to bypass these
restrictions, aside from keeping Emacs constantly running in the
foreground.

@section Android permissions
@cindex external storage, android

  Android also defines a permissions system that determines what
system services Emacs is allowed to access.  Programs must specify
what permissions they want; what then happens depends on the version
of Android being used:

@itemize @bullet
@item
On Android 5.1 and earlier, Emacs automatically receives the following
permissions it has requested upon being installed:

@itemize @minus
@item
@code{android.permission.READ_CONTACTS}
@item
@code{android.permission.WRITE_CONTACTS}
@item
@code{android.permission.VIBRATE}
@item
@code{android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION}
@item
@code{android.permission.INTERNET}
@item
@code{android.permission.SET_WALLPAPER}
@item
@code{android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE}
@item
@code{android.permission.SEND_SMS}
@item
@code{android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS}
@item
@code{android.permission.RECEIVE_MMS}
@item
@code{android.permission.WRITE_SMS}
@item
@code{android.permission.READ_SMS}
@item
@code{android.permission.NFC}
@item
@code{android.permission.TRANSMIT_IR}
@item
@code{android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE}
@item
@code{android.permission.WAKE_LOCK}
@item
@code{android.permission.FOREGROUND_SEVICE}
@item
@code{android.permission.REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES}
@item
@code{android.permission.REQUEST_DELETE_PACKAGES}
@item
@code{android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW}
@item
@code{android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO}
@item
@code{android.permission.CAMERA}
@end itemize

While most of these permissions are left unused by Emacs itself, they
are declared by Emacs as they could be useful for other programs; for
example, the permission to access contacts may be useful for EUDC.

@item
On Android 6.0 and later, Emacs only receives the following
permissions upon installation:

@itemize @minus
@item
@code{android.permission.VIBRATE}
@item
@code{android.permission.INTERNET}
@item
@code{android.permission.SET_WALLPAPER}
@item
@code{android.permission.NFC}
@item
@code{android.permission.TRANSMIT_IR}
@item
@code{android.permission.WAKE_LOCK}
@end itemize

Other permissions must be granted by the user through the system
settings application.  Consult the manufacturer of your device for
more details, as how to do this varies by device.
@end itemize

@section Android windowing

  Android has an unusual window system; there, all windows are
maximized or full-screen, and only one window can be displayed at a
time.  On larger devices, the system allows up to four windows to be
tiled on the screen at any time.

Windows on Android do not continue to exist indefinitely after they
are created.  Instead, the system may choose to terminate windows that
are not on screen in order to save memory, with the assumption that
the program will save its contents to disk and restore them later,
when the user asks to open it again.  As this is obvious not possible
with Emacs, Emacs separates a frame from a system window.

Each system window created (including the initial window created
during Emacs startup) is appended to a list of windows that do not
have associated frames.  When a frame is created, Emacs looks up any
window within that list, and displays the contents of the frame
within; if there is no window at all, then one is created.  Likewise,
when a new window is created by the system, Emacs places the contents
of any frame that is not already displayed within a window inside.
When a frame is closed, the corresponding system window is also
closed.

This strategy works as long as one window is in the foreground.
Otherwise, Emacs can only run in the background for a limited amount
of time before the process is killed completely.

@cindex windowing limitations, android
@cindex frame parameters, android
Due to the unusual nature of the Android windowing environment, Emacs
only supports a limited subset of GUI features.  Here is a list of
known limitations, and features which are not implemented:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The functions @code{raise-frame} and @code{lower-frame} are
non-functional, because of bugs in the window system.

@item
Scroll bars are not supported, as they are close to useless on Android
devices.

@item
The @code{alpha}, @code{alpha-background}, @code{z-group},
@code{override-redirect}, @code{mouse-color}, @code{cursor-color},
@code{cursor-type}, @code{title}, @code{wait-for-wm}, @code{sticky},
@code{undecorated} and @code{tool-bar-position} frame parameters
(@pxref{Frame Parameters,,, elisp, the Emacs Lisp Reference Manual})
are unsupported.

@item
The @code{fullscreen} frame parameter is always @code{maximized} for
top-level frames.
@end itemize

@node Android Fonts
@section Font backends and selection under Android
@cindex fonts, android

  Emacs supports two font backends under Android: they are respectively
named @code{sfnt-android} and @code{android}.

Upon startup, Emacs enumerates all the TrueType format fonts in the
directory @file{/system/fonts}; this is where the Android system
places fonts.  Emacs assumes there will always be a font named ``Droid
Sans Mono'', and then defaults to using this font.  These fonts are
then rendered by the @code{sfnt-android} font driver.

When running on Android, Emacs currently lacks support for TrueType
Container and OpenType fonts.  This means that only a subset of the
fonts installed on the system are currently available to Emacs.  If
you are interested in raising this limitation, please contact
@email{emacs-devel@@gnu.org}.

If the @code{sfnt-android} font driver fails to find any fonts at all,
Emacs falls back to the @code{android} font driver.  This is a very
lousy font driver, because of limitations and inaccuracies in the font
metrics provided by the Android platform.  In that case, Emacs uses
the ``Monospace'' typeface configured on your system; this should
always be Droid Sans Mono.
