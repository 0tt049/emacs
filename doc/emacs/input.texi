@appendix Emacs and unconventional input devices
@cindex other input devices

  Emacs was originally developed with the assumption that users will
be sitting in front of a desktop computer, with a keyboard and perhaps
a suitable pointing device such as a mouse.

  However, recent developments in the X Window System, and in other
operating systems such as Android, mean that this assumption no longer
holds true.  As a result, Emacs now has support for other kinds of
input devices, which is detailed here.

@cindex touchscreens

  Touchscreen input works by having the user press tools onto the
screen, which can be his own fingers, or a pointing device such as a
stylus, in order to manipulate the contents there in.

  When running under the X Window System or Android, Emacs
automatically detects and maps the following touchscreen gestures to
common actions:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@cindex tapping, touchscreens
  ``Tapping'', meaning to briefly place and lift a tool from the
display, will result in Emacs selecting the window that was tapped,
and executing any command bound to @code{mouse-1} at that location in
the window.  If the tap happened on top of a link (@pxref{Mouse
References}), then Emacs will follow the link instead.

@item
@cindex scrolling, touchscreens
  ``Scrolling'', meaning to place a tool on the display and move it up
or down, will result in Emacs scrolling the window contents in the
direction where the tool moves.

@item
@cindex dragging, touchscreens
  ``Dragging'', meaning to place a tool on the display and leave it
there for a while before moving the tool around, will make Emacs set
the point to where the tool was and begin selecting text under the
tool as it moves around, much like what would happen if @code{mouse-1}
were to be held down.  @xref{Mouse Commands}.
@end itemize

@vindex touch-screen-delay
  By default, Emacs considers a tool as having been left on the
display for a while after 0.7 seconds, but this can be changed by
customizing the variable @code{touch-screen-delay}.
