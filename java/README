This directory holds the Java sources of the port of GNU Emacs to
Android-like systems, along with files needed to create an application
package out of them.

`emacs.keystore' is the signing key used to build Emacs.  It is kept
here, and we encourage all people redistributing Emacs to use this
key.  It holds no security value, and otherwise it will be impossible
to install different builds of Emacs on top of each other.

Please keep the Java code indented with tabs and formatted according
to the rules for C code in the GNU coding standards.  Always use
C-style comments.
