This directory holds Makefiles and other required assets to build an
Emacs binary independently for another toolchain, which is currently
required when building for Android.

The files here are extremely ugly, and contain rules that cannot be
interrupted without leaving the build tree in an unsafe state.  At
some point that should be fixed!
