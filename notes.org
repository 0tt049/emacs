1) Scripting?

Guess we have to use sh

2) How to get specific directory of a repository



git archive --remote=phillord@git.savannah.gnu.org:/srv/git/emacs/elpa.git master packages/hydra | tar xv --strip-components=1

Currently, this requires a member login -- it doesn't work with http
or the current git server.

Would also be possible to configure this from local.

3) How to work out when a directory is out of date wrt to the make
   file

unpack the directory with the commit

SHAID-hydra

Then when the SHA is updated to point somewhere else, magically, the
directory will run out of space



4) Heuristics for working out which files to copy to right place

*-test.el
*-tests.el
/test/*.el

to test

All other *el to lisp

Nothing else

5) Work out what is the right place to copy to

lisp/elpa/package-name
test/lisp/elpa/package-name

is my prefered option. Eli may complain in which case "package-name"
can be dropped.


6) How to enable ELPA packages to customize the process

Add the option to run an core-deploy.sh file placed into the root of a
package.


7) What about make bootstrap

I think we would add another command called make clean-elpa which
would delete the elpa extracted files. I'd have to think very
carefully about which clean things I wanted to attach to. a priori
there is no reason to ever check the files out more than once.


8) Support other repos

Org-mode effectively does this already
